## Tool and Armor Strength:

-   Ruby and Sapphire tools and armour are both of equal strength, and are quite stronger than Diamond, due to the gems being quite rare.
-   Emerald tools and armour sit between Ruby/Sapphire and Diamond tools and armour strength-wise.
-   Topaz tools and armour are a bit weaker than Diamond.
-   Amethyst tools and armour are a bit stronger than iron, but weaker than Topaz.
-   Quartz tools and armour are a bit weaker than iron.
